/**
 * This layout is used to contain the extra information that will be displayed
 * when a certain cell is expanded. The custom relative layout is created in
 * order to achieve a fading affect of this layout's contents as it is being
 * expanded or collapsed as opposed to just fading the content in(out) after(before)
 * the cell expands(collapses).
 *
 * During expansion, layout takes place so the full contents of this layout can
 * be displayed. When the size changes to display the full contents of the layout,
 * its height is stored. When the view is collapsing, this layout's height becomes 0
 * since it is no longer in the visible part of the cell.By overriding onMeasure, and
 * setting the height back to its max height, it is still visible during the collapse
 * animation, and so, a fade out effect can be achieved.
